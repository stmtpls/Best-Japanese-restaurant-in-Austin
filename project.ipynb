For the probable high cost of the real estate and cost in rent they are in...I hope they improve their food to keep up with all the choices in Austin. The pictured menu from the window was enticing enough to get my BF and I to physically come back to try their advertised \"Ramen\" on the menu, whilst having Amy\\'s ice cream. Sad thing is...it was SUPER disappointing! The Ramen, is no Tatsuya...that\\'s for sure. Worst thing is..., my stove top, home cooked 0.10 cents Top Ramen would have tasted better. I had the Combo Ramen & BF had the Goyza Ramen. They nailed it on presentation, on taste....it was horrible! They both tasted the same with the exception to the added ingredients. Neither one of us finished our meal. It was the worst $10 for a bowl of cooked soggy noodles anyone could ever get. I believe the chefs were the 2 owners. No other staffs were seen in the visible kitchen. We had dinner at about 7:30pm, and there was only one other family dining in. The phone never rung once, in the 30 minutes we were in there, and no other clients arrived. We didn\\'t try any of the listed Sushi; but by the judge of their failure in something so simple as Ramen, and how few there were of clients to have dined, I cannot imagine how quickly they are able to sell their fish in order for it to stay fresh. \\xa0For the expensive price..., everything was self service, including bussing your own table, but Tip was expected. \\n\\nOverall, unless this cute place is under new management and new chefs, we will not be back!

The burnt orange but more reddish paint choice and how clean things are. Good sign so far..\\n\\nWe were all craving sushi so thats what we got and lots of it for not a big price. We ordered shrimp and veggie tempura to start which was not too big but it was okay. We ordered Maki A,C,C and each platter comes with 3 rolls for around 11-14 dollars. That is awesome!!!\\n\\nPlatters also come with miso soup which includes seaweed and green onion in it and I prefer that and loved every sip of it. Salad comes with a light ginger dressing which is sweet, powerful yet not too much. Perfect way to start a meal and it left us wondering how the sushi would be.\\n\\nMaki A was all around wonderful. Maki C was good except the eel roll in there was ehhh. I have had eel before but it tasted really weird to me. I will definately be going back here as the service was good, as was the food.

The service was excellent and very accommodating to our high maintenance party of 8 including 3 picky eating kids and the food was delicious and beautifully presented. And the prices are very reasonable and even down right cheap - sushi rolls start at 3.95 and that's a Tuna Roll - considering the prime real estate and the quality and freshness I was very impressed by the prices. \\n\\nWe started with Broiled Alaskan Black Cod in a sweet Miso Sauce that tasted amazing and melted on the tongue like butter! \\n\\nMy Sister ordered a Sashimi Salad - slices of Tuna, Salmon and Yellowtail on a bed of mixed greens that was beautiful. My Sis hovered over her salad and did not offer any tastes so I trust it was as good as she said it was. \\n\\nMy parents don't eat raw food. They loved the Teriyaki Chicken and Sake Marinated Salmon they shared and I loved the wasabi mashed potatoes that came as a side. Yum! \\n\\nThe Bro In-Law and I shared a bunch of Sushi. To keep it short our favorites were the the Steiner Ranch (smoked salmon, tempura fried asparagus, sprouts and cream cheese topped with strawberries and a sweet miso glaze) and the Bentley (fatty tuna, spicy snow crab, scallions, cucumber and sprouts topped with thin slices of seared beef and a honey bourbon glaze). These 2 rolls were as good as any of the specialty rolls/plates I have had at Uchi! \\n\\nLocated in the old Delicato location next to Thai Harmony in a strip mall in Steiner Ranch. Don't let it scare ya.

And I don't like seafood.\\n\\nThe tiny selection of other offerings at Yanagi are still really delightful; so much so that I've been coming here for 2-3 years and never been disappointed. It feels a little pricey for a college student pocketbook, but when you get about two meals' worth of food... turns out the price isn't so bad after all. My favourite is the chicken bulgogi bento box.\\n\\nI love the decor and the music is pretty much what plays on 94.7. The lighting is gentle and the shades are always down, which is really a plus in Texas and adds to the ambience. The servers I've had were mostly friendly but not overly chatty. It does feel a little weird to come here in casual clothes because the restaurant and servers always look so professional, but I almost never see diners in anything fancier than jeans and a t-shirt-once even saw some little soccer players and their families out after a game. I always go lunchtime to early afternoon, though. Maybe it's different at night.\\n\\nI've used the take-out service too. Most of the food was still tasty, but never try this for the tempura-the same light breading that makes it so delightful fresh gets soggy very quickly in a box.\\n\\nMajor plus for location.

Sushi Juani is an awesome place to meet up with friends to enjoy AYCE sushi! Lunch will set you back $19.95 for adults and for kiddos 2-7 $10.95 while dinner service is $29.95 for adults and for children under $15.95. There is no sharing from the AYCE dining guests with those opting for a la cart. Lunch is limited to 60 minutes for AYCE while dinner is limited to 90 minutes. \\n\\nThe host, chefs and our waiter were upbeat and super friendly. We didn't come prepared with an appetite for the AYCE so we opted for a couple a la cart menu items. They serve bottled beers, sake and wine. I would recommend that Sushi Junai list their wines in more detail on the wine menu and perhaps get the staff trained up on knowing what is served as our waiter replied he did not know. And he didn't offer to find out for me until I asked him to do so. This location is new and really that was the only small kink in the experience. I ordered the cucumber paradise roll and Jesse ordered tonkatsu. I enjoyed my rice-less sashimi style roll with a variety of fish wrapped in fresh cucumber but I would opt to order it without the sauce that was very garlicy next time. Jesse tonkatsu was a great value! The crisp pork cutlet was served up nice and warm with a house katsu sauce served with rice, veggies, salad and a cup of miso for $12.95.\\n\\nMy tip is come here for the rolls and do AYCE or get a hardy dish like the tonkatsu. If you are going a la cart for the sushi the price point is high enough that I may lean towards going to my go to stay sushi spots.\", rating=None)),\n",

Told a group of people about my plans, and they all exclaimed: \"NO!!!!!\" Austin is quickly vaulting to national prominence as a gourmand\\'s destination, and Dorothy D. and Michelle F. warned me that I\\'d be passing up an opportunity. Intrigued by their fervor and passion, I began reconsidering. I changed my mind for good when one Mark H., a local resident, insisted that I absolutely had to go here, sit at the bar to watch the \"sausage\" (sushi) made. Like Dorothy D. and Michelle F., he was also appalled at the idea of wasting an Austin dinner with a burger and fries. (Thank God that I didn\\'t tell him I ate a slice of pizza from 7-11 because I got in at 2 AM the previous night, and it was all that was available!!)\\n\\nUchi it was. Austin resident and buddy Julie M. warned me of the swank factor and the pricetag, but as they say, \"When in Austin...\" Half of me kind of wanted the place to be bad so that I could do an EWWWWchi pun, like what I did with EWWWWmani Burger (Umani Burger, LAX location only, not the whole chain.) The food is pretty unbelievable, though. I went all-out and had the following: 18-piece sashimi platter, hamachi nabe (rice yellow tail thing), akami te (big-eyed tuna appetizer thing), 12 additional pieces of tuna and salmon, and finally some Japanese cheesecake. I sat next to two college-aged kids and this annoying dude in a baseball cap who kept making creepy comments and looked like disgraced former Lakers Basketball Operations President/manchild Jim Buss (pbs.twimg.com/profile_im…). Their reaction to each successive dish was WTF!!! (Hey, maybe it\\'s your obsession with superficial body image metrics that\\'s the problem, ever think of that?!)\\n\\nExcept for the Japanese cheesecake, all of these were absolutely sublime. I\\'ve argued in this space that sushi does not probably have as much of an upside given that it\\'s fundamentally just raw fish in the end. But uchi has a way of putting a truly unique stamp on it that I\\'m surprised other places don\\'t try more. They put something in the soy sauce that gives it a slight tang. It feels like just a touch of wasabi and maybe garlic or green onion. I dunno! Each sashimi dish is also topped off with a seat of unique seasonings, like aioili (sp) on one of them. While I still thing excellent sushi is excellent sushi in the end, regardless of where you have it or what the price tag is, I do appreciate these little bells and whistles, plus superb aesthetic in the presentation. The non-sushi dish, hamachi nabe, was INSANE and the best part. I wish I had known it would be this good, because I would have ordered like 2-3 of them. (I didn\\'t for reasons that I\\'ll discuss below.) This is probably the best rice dish that I have ever had in my life.\\n\\nI ultimately have to dock a star as part of my ongoing effort to curb grade inflation here at MC3. #MerlinFIVEEEEEES (elongate the vowel, elevate the pitch) can\\'t be growing on trees. Here are the two reasons why. First, the queueing theory (QT) game is not good. The stuff came out really slowly, and I\\'d say I spent 90 more minutes next to annoying Jim Buss guy than I had to. I didn\\'t know to do this, but you should definitely just ask them to bring the stuff all out at once and not to stagger it. I think they do this so it feels like a typical multi-course fancy meal, but I wasn\\'t here for that. I was here to GET IN, EAT, and GET OUT (GIEGO!) Your stomach also starts getting impatient and threatens to close up if you go on too long like this, but this is me with the #TEAMAZN metabolism so luckily that wasn\\'t an issue. Second, I was underwhelmed by the dessert. \\n\\nDecor is nice and not over the top, unlike many fancypants sushi places (ugh to every time I see another fake cultural appropriating Buddha statue at a fushion restaurant). And unlike those places, people at Uchi dress in a way that doesn\\'t make you seem like you walked into a Saks Fifth Avenue robo-mannequin display from 2036.', rating=None)),\n",

When we arrived, we were immediately impressed by the ambience. The restaurant was well decorated and seemed to be a place to see and be seen.\\n\\nWe ordered the brussel sprouts, a few sushi rolls, and the hot rock flank. The brussel sprouts were great, but the rest of our food fell short of our expectations. The sushi was expensive (over $15.00 a roll) and was much smaller than the sushi rolls we are accustomed to (I believe maybe 6 pieces per order). The hot rock flank lacked flavor and we felt this was also overpriced. Maybe we ordered the wrong items, but to us it seemed that Uchiko was over-priced for the food we were delivered. Don't get me wrong the location, ambiance, and décor are on point - but we did expect more based on the price of our dinner. \\n\\nI understand that Uchiko has happy hour deals, so I'd give their happy hour a try.

We have long sought a place like this in Austin -- how did we not know it was less than 2 miles from our house in central austin? No matter, we're glad we found it. There's something here for all us -- mom and dad who've eaten every kind of japanese food, from ultra-expensive to street noodles, and can always find something to make them happy; kids willing to take a few risks; and the kid who won't risk anything but will scarf down tempura-fried shrimp all night long. Teppan gets all the basics right, and even the miso soup is a cut above -- fresh, thoughtful, and deep. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is sweet -- clever design abounds, but in the background, creating a pleasing simplicity with delight in the details. However, the old terrazzo floor is grimy and needs to be diamond-polished to bring it back to spec to be as clean as the rest of the lines and surfaces, and the tables up front, surrounded by glass, can be echoey and loud at lunchtime -- I have to cup my ears to hear my wife across the table. Rear tables, however, are much quieter. \\n\\nNow that we've found Lavaca Teppan, we pray that it stays. It's very busy at lunch, not so much at dinner. However, its location just south of UT and just north of the capital is very much in transition, and I would expect more people to discover it. If you do -- as we did on a casual, happenstance walk -- please read this review and take the risk. You'll be glad you did. Is it Uchi? Of course not: it's 1/5th the price and positioned as that place you go to satisfy yourself on a worknight without cooking. Nothing good ever lasts, so we plan to gorge on Teppan until that day when, like all things, it disappears and we're left wondering where to get our fix on good, basic Japanese-style noodles.\\n\\nWe don't go here for sushi, and this review does not encompass it.\", rating=None)),\n",

Biggest location in the US at the moment too. \\n\\nCome and sign in on the iPad and it'll give you a number and text you when it's almost you're turn. There's a spacious waiting area so enjoy sitting inside with the AC. There's not a lot of shops in the plaza so parking is abundant.\\n\\nThe sushi comes around on the conveyor belt so start grabbing when you see what you like! Don't see what you want? Order from the touch pad screen and it'll come zooming towards you. \\n\\nAt $2.25/plate, try whatever you like. 15 plates gets you a toy. Small plates, ramen, and certain dessert plates don't count towards the 15 plates as you can't put the bowl down the plate slot. \\n\\nBest recommendation is to always get the Japanese Style Soy Milk Donuts! Very good and warm paired with vanilla ice cream.

Almost every dish we ordered was DELICIOUS as well as creative. This place had a very interesting and unique Japanese-Texas fusion thing going on, with everything from the decor (Texas flags mixed with vintage Japanese posters?) to the dishes and drinks (Takoyaki and chili yes pls). Below is a run down of everything we ordered:\\n\\nTHE GREAT:\\n- BBQ Eel: very tender and had a delicious smoky flavor! Definitely get this if you\\'re a fan of unagi.\\n- Duck Breast: Very flavorful and the sauce provided complemented the duck nicely. It had just the right amount of fat and smokiness to it.\\n- Hot Pockets: YUM! These put microwave hotpockets to shame. Nice creamy, cheesy nuttiness combined with a nice crunch from the outer shell.\\n- Chili Cheese Takoyaki: Super creative take on chili/takoyaki. I never thought these two things would go so well together. I especially loved the chips that it came with to dip with the sauce. \\n- Matcha Painkiller: Sweet, tropical drink that comes in the CUTEST container! (its a little cat with a paper straw~) I\\'m not usually a fan of tea/matcha but this was amazing and the matcha flavor is not overpowering. \\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\n- Roasted Banana Pudding: Yummy! The bottom of the pudding had a delicious miso caramel that honestly made the dish. The texture of the pudding contrasted nicely with the crunchy bits at the top. \\n- Fish Collar: The fish was tender but definitely had a fishy taste to it, which I actually enjoyed but others may not.\\n- Fries with Eyes: There was also a strong fishy taste to this one (which again could be a good or a bad thing). I did however enjoy the crispiness of this one. If you like anchovies, you might like this. \\n- Texas Ramen: Interesting take on ramen, loved the brisket however I liked the dipping ramen better.\\n- BBQ Tsukemen: Compared to the dipping ramen at Ramen Tatsuya, I think this one was better and more flavorful, especially with the bits of brisket. The ajitama appeared to taste the same as the one that they used at their other location. \\n- Sticky Rice Tamale: Probably one of the best tamales that I\\'ve had. Who knew beef tongue would be so good in a tamale?\\n\\nMEH: \\n- Brisket Uni Sashimi: Flavor was a bit off on this one. The other dishes with brisket were better in my opinion. \\n- Chicken Karage: This was delicious as the meat was all chicken thigh, and it wasn\\'t too dry. My only caveat was that this is a common dish that could be found anywhere, and this wasn\\'t the best Karage I\\'ve had. \\n- Shio Kara: This was the \"squid marinated in its own guts\" as described by the menu. This dish was extremely salty, and as a person who usually loves squid, it was a bit much for me.\\n- Natto: We had the traditional version of the fermented soy beans. They were served cold and were not as \"nasty\" as the menu description made them seem.

I gave them two stars just because I know it\\'s the same owner and the ambience is .. cool. Now everything else about this review won\\'t be so cool. I have been a server at many low-end to high end sushi places so I\\'m really patient and understanding with service when it comes to these places, butttt this was awful. \\n\\nI made a reservation for a birthday and since we were seated at the high tops in the bar near the entrance I had to sneak the cake into the place without him seeing. I told the hostess this and that the birthday guy was right by the stand. She said okay. So when our bill came, I looked over at my boyfriend wondering where the cake was. He went to ask and she attempted to hand him the cake in the bag as if for him to bring it over, light it up and serve the table. He obviously asked them to do it. Because, who does that? On top of that, the table was filthy when they bought out plates and soup spoons. Yes, soup spoons for cake. At this point, I was over this place. You don\\'t charge $$$ and treat your customers like an inconvenience especially on special occasions. There were many hiccups like this through the night, like when we said we ordered 1 salmon skin roll and the runner told our server, he yelled out behind the bar, \"Yeah, they ordered 2 but whatever just put it back on their table\". Rude.\\n\\nSo there\\'s my essay about service now here\\'s the food review. If you\\'re wondering if the value is worth the drive up north to Cedar Park, it is. They charged 14$ (that\\'s like charging 14$ for an eel cucumber roll) for a salmon skin roll that I didn\\'t finish. Server said it\\'s not on the menu but they could whip it up, wished he would have said no because it was overly salty with no crisp and for that pricing, dude just take my arm instead. We did all the rolls on the menu, the Uni pasta and some appetizers. In general, more on the saltier palate but nothing special in general. The truffle tuna roll is good, definitely would recommend. The Uni pasta didn\\'t have truffle on top but this is their most consistent dish, very rich and savory. \\n\\nHonestly, I wanted to support this establishment but it was one thing after the other. If you want to compete against bigger names in the area for sushi, you should provide quality with service-better training for their servers to be discrete with their banter and protocols for special occasions.', rating=None)),\n",

We considered grabbing another waiter (many of whom were milling about the dining room) but just waited it out in hopes of trying this delicious roll. The salmon had the texture of rubber.

We were so excited for the cheesy roll and it was like it had been left sitting out so the cheese had solidified. \\n\\nAll together, we spent $100.

I highly recommend their restaurants if you are visiting or even live in Austin. \\nSo what's the difference between Uchi and Uchiko? Essentially, they are almost the same restaurant serving very similar food; however, Uchiko is known to be slightly cheaper, more spacious so less wait time, and it takes reservation at this location. There is something new that they didn't have before when I first visited here long time ago, the Sake Socials, daily 5-6:30 PM. That's a wonderful news for me because I get to enjoy their high quality food with less money! \\nWe went to Uchi first around 5:30 pm but they already all filled up with the wait time of 1.5 hours. We later changed location to Uchiko. We got lucky to find a seat at their bar quickly, which is first come first serve. If you can, I recommend to make a reservation first. Otherwise, the wait time is usually more than 1 hour. \\nOn their Sake Socials menu, there are many good items to pick from. There were items we selected:\\n\\nYOKAI BERRY (salmon, kale, asian pear, blueberry, yuzu) - excellent dish to start the meal. Salmon was fatty, cut in small chucks. Balanced flavor with all items. I love the touch of Asian pear with salmon and kale. \\n\\nGYUTAN NIGIRI (grilled beef tongue sushi) - another excellent dish! The beef tongue was cut in sashimi size and grilled to perfection. It is then served on top of rice. The combination of grilled beef tongue and rice was perfect. \\n\\nSALMON RICE BOWL (crispy rice, ajitama egg, onion) - highly recommend this dish!! Salmon was cooked with light seasoning. the crispy rice was done perfectly with fish sauce flavor. the pouched egg was also perfectly executed, ready to be mixed in with the dish. lastly the onion finished up the final flavor. Overall, well designed and executed dish. Every ingredient served a purpose in the dish. Nothing was out of element or over powering the flavor. \\n\\nBRUSSELS SPROUTS (fish caramel, lemon, chili) - didn't expect to see they serve Brussels sprouts but as always they did a good job. The flavor was expected as usually how it is prepared. Not a bad dish but I didn't see the same level of creativity as other dishes. \\n\\nTEKKA ROLL (tuna, nori) - simple tuna cut roll. good quality of all elements. \\n\\nNEGIHAMA ROLL (japanese yellowtail, negi, ponzu) - simple roll yet full of flavors. High quality yellowtail with touch of green onion cut roll. It's good with Ponzu sauce but I also like just with simple soy sauce. The green onion brings out the yellowtail flavor and provides more in depth flavor. \\n\\nkOMAKI ROLL (romaine, gobo, pickled red pepper, \\xa0lemon miso) - surprisingly, this vege roll was my favorite roll tonight. I was caught off guard by how interesting this roll was. All the elements were dancing in my mouth with each bite. The lemon miso topped off the flavor. I highly recommend this roll if you are the adventurous type. \\n\\nAt this point, hopefully you are convinced that you HAVE TO visit Uchiko to get a taste of their creativity. If you are not, the next dish will, which is their dessert! It doesn't matter if you are a dessert person or not. Everyone should try their dessert if you come regardless how much you ate already! \\n\\nToday's special dessert is serving in a cup of honey crumbles on the bottom, jasmine cream, cilantro sorbet, and fresh pineapple cubes on top. It is absolutely amazing!!!! Honestly, there is no words to describe the magic flavor that was created by the combination of these items. The honey crumbles gave the dessert its texture and sweetness. The jasmine tea cream was smooth, fragrant, and soft melting in your mouth. Cilantro sorbet was genius, which provides refreshing flavor, yet slightly salty contrast to the cream and honey crumbles. Lastly, the pineapple gave the sweet and sour flavor to the dish. Each item was perfect on its own but the combination was beyond imagination. I am not a dessert person but I will always order their dessert when I visit. You can literally taste the creativity in their dessert. \\xa0\\n\\nIf there is a way to give 6 stars to this place, I will for sure give them the highest rating possible.

If you are lucky, you can find one right outside the restaurant. \\n\\nI\\'ve been here at least 4 times and it is surprising that I decided to give it 1 star. I\\'ll explain why...\\n\\nInterior: there is limited seating, if you arrive at around 12-12:30 or at some point after 6 (lunch starts around 11, dinner around 5) you may have trouble being seated. Because of the style of the restaurant (all you can eat) the wait is also incredibly long. If you arrive and there are not seats, you may as well leave and come back another time because you could be waiting for 1+ hrs. The restaurant is clean and well kept, just tiny. \\n\\nService: the service here is incredibly slow. It\\'s not really the fault of the waiters, it seems there is just a limited number of sushi chefs in comparison to the number of orders that they receive. If you ever eat here, my advise is to order your \"dish\" as soon as you get your previous order. If you order once you\\'ve finished a dish, you will never get it in time. The waiters/waitresses are generally pretty nice, no complaints. The downside, and its a big one, is just the slow pace that everything is served. Don\\'t be surprised if you are there for 3 hrs before you are full/satisfied.\\n\\nFood: The first couple times I went, the food was pretty good. I didn\\'t really have an issues with it. For a sushi buffet, the food was generally pretty good. HOWEVER, when I went recently, the food was absolutely disgusting. The rice for the nigiri and the rolls were under-cooked and I was eating crunchy rice with my sushi. That may have been ok with some other cuisine, but it was definitely not with Japanese! It was not worth my money this time around. My conclusion, they have become lax after enjoying business from so many student patrons who come out to their location. \\n\\nAll in all, I will most likely not be revisiting this restaurant. I have had better meals at other places in Austin and will go to those places in the future if I need sushi. They no longer have a bring your own alcohol policy since they now serve alcohol.

I know everyone in Austin has one place as their gold standard, but if you prevent that from clouding your perceptions of JINYA, objectively the ramen here is pretty great. \\n\\nI got the tonkotsu black and my wife the wonton ramen. The wontons are large and pairs well with a light chicken broth. Could use a bit more seasoning in the soup, so my wife ended up adding a good deal of sauce to spike it, but she was quite happy with it. The tonkotsu ramen I felt was fantastic by and large and like most good noodle soups, all about that broth. Not too salty, creamy and rich but distinctly porky in a good way. The thin noodles soak up the rich pork bone broth flavor and are nice and slurp-able. \\n\\nThe toppings themselves were average, nothing stellar. The egg is ok - the seasoning is not that strong, but hard to hate boiled eggs. The pork is alright too - its fatty and has a nice luxurious mouth feel, though could use a stronger flavor profile, but at least its not dry like some other shops. Make sure you grab some kaedama with your meal if you're still hungry - they basically double your noodles for another few bucks that will leave you glowing since you get to soak in more of that broth.\\n\\nWhat holds this place back? The servers are pretty slow even though they weren't that busy when we got there. Like slow enough where I don't want to tip but I feel bad for them so I'll still tip them a bit. But really, we saw our server at the beginning, another like 15 min later before we got to order. When the server was present they were lightning quick to get us what we needed and stuff done, but trying to flag one down is about as hard as someone who has never used chopsticks before trying to eat their food. \\n\\nSo all in all, great ramen shop in a good location but with poor service.

It\\'s a bit more spacious, and they\\'ve used it well. \\n\\nIt\\'s been a minute since I hit up Kome for dinner, and in that time they\\'ve added some things that I recommend: the Kome Fries (waffle-style) serve as a wonderful foil to the delicious honey-wasabi aioli--this is what honey mustard should be. The Blue Fin Tuna Poke is well balanced, and served with \"shrimp chips\" which were light, puffy rice crisps. The Mabo Tofu was richly flavored with a nice moderate heat. \\n\\nEven the staples seem better at Kome 2.0, like the Crunchy Dynamite Roll that you can get for $5 during happy hour. Speaking of which, the Kome happy hour is a literal hour, and with the new liquor license, comes fully prepared to turn a rough work-induced weekday around. \\n\\nWhile I cannot tell you Kome is the best sushi in town (Kyoten and Uchiko come to mind, among many others), or the cheapest edible sushi in town (hello Central Market, hat-tip to DK, and not to leave Pacific Rim during happy hour unmentioned), it is a solid A that marries quality ingredients, good service, an enjoyable ambiance, and a diverse menu in an affordable package. \\n\\n---\\n\\nNotes: Kome is almost always on a (long) wait for dinner. Yes, even for 2. There is a non-service waiting area. They seat at the bar like tables, so the wait cannot be avoided by sitting at the bar.

I'm not the one to care much about presentation, but I thought I'd mention that the nigiri pieces literally seemed to be carelessly thrown together on the plate. The fish itself tasted good, but the pieces were very thin and the rice overpowered. Later, I decided to get the usual strawberry mochi ice cream for dessert.

I was out of town when they first opened and I literally came here directly from the airport the day I returned. It did not disappoint. First, the best part of the experience for me was the crew starting with the head man himself Chef Kasu Fukumoto. It not only was a pleasure to see Chef Kasu at work, but also meeting him. For someone as talented as he is, he is quite humble and unassuming which I can't help but respect. Unlike with Uchi where I feel they treat you like you are lucky to be there. Chef Kasu treats you like he is lucky to have you there. It trickles down to his staff. With great care and some appreciated humor Adriana and Kap were fantastic and helped guide me through a great meal. A few others helped out as well and all were superb and really nice. There were zero new restaurant kinks to be worked through. They already operate as a well oiled machine of awesomeness. I ordered the following:\\n\\nSushi:\\nKama Toro - Delicious melt in your mouth good.\\nGreen Tea Fed Red Snapper - Different, subtle, great, try it.\\nOra King Fatty Salmon - A bit disappointing. The texture was off (not as tender as I'm accustomed to) and I did not get that buttery flavor I was expecting.\\nUni - Fresh, tasted like the ocean (as it should).\\n\\nYakatori:\\nBeef Tongue - Great flavor, tender and savory.\\nChicken Sausage - This had great flavor too and the quail egg and bonito flakes dip took it to another level.\\n\\nI loved the atmosphere with the dark wood and minimalist layout. I also really like their chopsticks. Their sushi and yakitori are prepared with genuine care, and you'll be hard pressed to find it done any better in ATX. Again, the service was stellar as well.

When it's busy it can be a little bit slower than usual, but food still comes out somewhat continuously. The north location is much bigger, and there's probably 4x more seating than the downtown location.\\n\\nAs for the food, my usual appetizers are the Screaming O, White O, Edamame, Mixed Tempura, and Agadashi Tofu. I then order a crapload of nigiri.. some of my favorites are the salmon belly, yellowtail, beef, sweet shrimp, and escolar. The only roll I order (because i don't want to fill up on rice) is the cucumber passion. There's no rice at all and it's very light and delicious.\\n\\nSushi Junai has become my place to get my sushi fixes whenever I have a craving. The fish is fresh and the food is good. I have introduced a lot of my friends to the original one downtown and now this one for the friends that live closer up north and none of them have regretted it. Definitely come check it out if you're really hungry and craving sushi.\", rating=None)),\n",

    "1. Restaurants which are highly rated in terms of the attributes on the basis of which the user is seeking recommendation, appears at a lower rank when listed solely based on ratings. Therefore, simply building the recommendation system on user ratings does not meet the requirements of the user looking for recommendations.\n",
    "2. The restaurant 'Haru Sushi - formerly known Hanabi' is the most desirable restaurant in terms of the user mentioned attributes. However, it is ranked 9th in terms of ratings and far behind restaurants which are barely mentioned when the four attributes (Service, Food, Price,Location) are discussed in the reviews.\n",
    "3. Based on the ratings, the best japanese restaurant is \"Baja St Tacos & Coastal Cuisine\" which is not a traditional japanese restaurant and while it is highly rated by people that like the combination of tex-mex and japanese cuzine, it is not highly correlated to japanese \"food\" and as a result it may not be suitable for people looking for japanese flavors.\n",
    "4. The list of 200 reviews with the highest cosine similarity includes no review of the \"top three based on ratings\" restaurants, which indicates that while those restaurants get positive feedback same is not strongly correlated to the four identifed aspects and as a result they do not present a good value proposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, I can say that the \"top three based on ratings\" recommended restaurants, did not meet the requirements of the users looking for recommendations. The website's recommendation system would be much improved incorporating aspects and features to the search engine (e.g. Service, Food, Price, Location) helping users find exactly what they are looking for."
